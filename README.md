# Diode-PN-Junction-Characterization-PSU-ECE515

## Description
This repository contains an in-depth characterization of the PN junction diode 1N4148, focusing on analyzing its current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at room and elevated temperatures. Conducted for the ECE 515: Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices course at Portland State University, this project uses Excel for data analysis, offering insights into diode behavior through graphical analysis and theoretical model comparisons.

## Data Analysis
Excel was chosen for its interactivity and simplicity in handling the project's data analysis requirements. The analysis involves:
- Plotting linear and semi-logarithmic I-V characteristics.
- Fitting the data to the diode equation to extract parameters like the ideality factor and saturation current.
- Assessing the impact of temperature on diode performance.
- Comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions.

## Repository Structure
- **Collected Data/**: Contains raw data files used in the analysis.
- **Analysis Sheets/**: Excel files with plotted graphs and fitted models.
- **Report/**: Detailed project report including methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for navigating the repository.

## Results Overview
The project successfully demonstrates the temperature dependence of the diode's I-V characteristics, revealing significant insights into the diode's operational behavior. Key findings include the extraction of the diode's ideality factor and saturation current, and the observation of shifts in the I-V curve with temperature changes.
